\chapter*{Abstract}
\begin{SingleSpace}
\initial{T}he absolute values of the neutron flux over the vertical axis of the core can be computed by irradiating a sample and determining the neutron flux received from spectrometry results. Knowing the absolute neutron flux values at different positions in or out the core can be used to obtain local peak factor in the fuel elements, more precise fuel burnup, the production rate of fission products, and other useful information. Well chosen target materials are used. They are irradiated for a given period of time, after which the samples decay until they can be used in the spectrometry chamber. Their activation are used to compute the neutron flux they experienced within the reactor.

Sodium is used in this experiment to calculate the flux in the central thimble. Due to some amount of measurement errors, we had to disregard two of our data points, which tremendously skewed our final results. We expect that accurate measurements at these two positions would have given us more insight into the flux profile across the central thimble. As these two positions were near to the center of the thimble, we would expect them to have high values of flux, and as such, we would expect a more symmetric flux profile across the central line. Thus, we must recommend that this lab be repeated in order to obtain more valid measurements.

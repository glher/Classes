\chapter*{Abstract}
\begin{SingleSpace}
\initial{T}he absolute values of the neutron flux over the vertical axis of the core can be computed by irradiating a sample and determining the neutron flux received from spectrometry results. Knowing the absolute neutron flux values at different positions in or out the core can be used to obtain local peak factor in the fuel elements, more precise fuel burnup, the production rate of fission products, and other useful information. Well chosen target materials are used. They are irradiated for a given period of time, after which the samples decay until they can be used in the spectrometry chamber. Their activation are used to compute the neutron flux they experienced within the reactor.

Sodium is used in this experiment to calculate the flux in the central thimble. The results obtained are inconclusive.

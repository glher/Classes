\chapter*{Abstract}
\begin{SingleSpace}
\initial{W}hen the positive reactivity added to a critical core is equal to the effective delayed neutron franction, $\beta_{eff}$, prompt criticality is achieved. That corresponds to a positive reactivity of $1\$$. Super prompt critical states arise when the reactivity insertion is above this one dollar limit. Essentially, in this state of operation, the delayed neutrons do not control the reactor period, and the power grows exponentially.

TRIGA reactors such as the GSTR are able to withstand this power excursion by design, due to the decrease in the thermal non-leakage probability caused by the fuel temperature effect. From pulsing, it is possible to compute the prompt neutron lifetime, the negative temperature coefficient and the specific heat of the core. The Fuchs-Nordheim model approximation will be tested against the experimental values obtained.

Despite larger errors associated with larger prompt reactivity insertion, the Fuchs-Nordheim model is shown to be in good agreement with the measured data, with the correct correlations between the prompt reactivity insertion and the different parameters of the core (peak power, period, shape of the power time distribution, ...).

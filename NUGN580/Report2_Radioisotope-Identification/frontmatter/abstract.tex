\chapter*{Abstract}
\begin{SingleSpace}
\initial{R}esearch nuclear reactors such as the GSTR are capable of identifying the composition of unknown samples. This is done by bombarding them with neutrons to activate them, obtaining the half-life of the activation products and identify the gamma-ray discrete energies released. A library can then be used on the spectrum to identify which nucleides decay generated the various peaks.

This method can also give the quantities (mass) of each nucleide in the sample. However, only an energy calibration of the spectrometer was performed, hence this information was not made computed.

This report is organized as follow. In the first part, the theory is explained so that the objective of this experiment becomes clear. In the second part, the procedures used are described. Then, the results obtained are presented and error and uncertainties are finally discussed.

The library used during this experiment showed, in hindsight, a weakness. The main peak generated by the sample was not identified as it should have been. Ongoing work is being performed to update this library at the GSTR.

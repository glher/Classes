\chapter*{Abstract}
\begin{SingleSpace}
\initial{W}hile operating a nuclear reactor, one of the big concerns is the Xenon concentration in the core. Stable during nominal operations, the Xenon concentration builds up, from Iodine decay mostly, in the core in the hours following a shutdown. $^{135}Xe$ being a potent neutron poison, this buildup can cause the reactor to be inoperable for a couple of days afterward.

Moreover, $^{135}Xe$ buildup has an effect on the flux distribution within the core, flattening it in the most reactive fuel elements (where its presence is more noticeable). This is of particular importance in power reactors, in which Xenon oscillations happen.

It is consequently primordial to understand the Xenon effect and know its concentration in the core.

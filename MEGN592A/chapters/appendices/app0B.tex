\chapter{Failure Modes and Effects Analysis}
\label{app:app02}

\initial{F}MEA asks for the creation of a table which associate a (Probability, Severity, Detectability)-triplet and a corresponding RPN to a (failure mode, cause)-doublet of a component. Potential mitigation action can also be added, as well as its cost and other useful information during the design process. Table~\ref{tab:fmea_risk} presents the(P, S, D)-triplets associated with a number of potential failures and causes. It is to be noted that, by essence of the real-world FMEA in a complex system, the list presented is not exhaustive. It shows the failure modes that the author thought were most likely to have a higher RPN.

Table~\ref{tab:fmea_rpn_risk} presents, for each and every identified failure modes, possible mitigation action that could be taken.

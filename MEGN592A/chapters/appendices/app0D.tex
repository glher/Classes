\chapter{Function Failure Identification and Propagation}
\label{app:app04}

\initial{S}everal initiating events are considered, and the propagation of the failures is computed using FFIP methodology. The loss of the function \textit{Signal - Sense - Measure} linked to the \textit{Energy - Radioactive} flow is propagated on figure~\ref{fig:ffip1}. This is equivalent to the loss of neutron detectors in a RBD. Next, the loss of the function {Channel - Guide - Rotate}, which connect the flow \textit{Material - Gas} with \textit{Energy - Mechanical} is propagated on figure~\ref{fig:ffip2}. This is equivalent to the loss of the turbines in a RBD. Furthermore, the loss of the function \textit{Convert - Convert} converting vapor flow to liquid flow is propagated on figure~\ref{fig:ffip3}. THis is equivalent to the loss of the condensers in a RBD.

Two critical functions are defined. These functions are the one that are critical to the system reliability (electricity generation) and the system risks (preventing a core meltdown).

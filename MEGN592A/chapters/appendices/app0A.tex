\chapter{Reliability Block Diagram}
\label{app:app01}

\initial{R}eliability block diagrams, for a system as complex as a nuclear plant especially, can become huge and hard to read. In order to facilitate the reading, the case study has been divided in four systems: primary, secondary, tertiary and structure~\ref{fig:rbd_global}. For each of those systems, the redundant components are indicated by a block instead of a simple rectangle. Those blocks are then analyzed in more details in subsequent figures.

\section{Global system}

The structure is considered only for the primary circuit in the present case study. However, we could also choose to consider the secondary and tertiary circuits structure in our analyses. This would be, for example, the control room roof caving in or a plane falling on the steam generator building, etc.
